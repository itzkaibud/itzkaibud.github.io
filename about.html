        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Kai Turley, a passionate sound designer for games and a dedicated composer. With over 20 years of experience playing music and over a decade as an audio engineer, I bring a rich background in audio creation and manipulation. Over the past year, I’ve been deeply involved in game development, participating in game jams and collaborating on various projects to refine my skills in sound design.</p>
        <p>My journey in music and audio began as a multi-instrumentalist and has evolved into a career where I blend my love for music with my technical expertise. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Music Composition from San Diego State University and an Associate of Arts in Recording Production from MiraCosta Community College. Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working on diverse projects, including film scoring, live sound engineering, and music production.</p>
        <p>My proficiency in programming all kinds of synthesizers, from modular to granular, allows me to create unique and immersive soundscapes for games.</p>
        <p>Whether I’m composing an epic game soundtrack or designing intricate sound effects, my goal is to enhance the player’s experience through high-quality audio that brings games to life. Let’s create something extraordinary together!</p>
